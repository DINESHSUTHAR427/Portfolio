# Dinesh Suthar - Personal Portfolio Website
url => https://dineshsutharr.vercel.app/

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background as a web developer. It features a modern, single-page design with a dynamic and visually engaging user interface.



## About The Project

This portfolio was created to be a central hub for my professional identity. It's a place where I can share my journey, highlight my achievements, and present my work to potential employers and collaborators. The design is intentionally bold and attention-grabbing, using a dark theme with red accents and a dynamic background to create a memorable experience.

### Built With

*   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
*   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
