## About The Project

This portfolio was created to be a central hub for my professional identity. It's a place where I can share my journey, highlight my achievements, and present my work to potential employers and collaborators. The design is intentionally bold and attention-grabbing, using a dark theme with red accents and a dynamic background to create a memorable experience.

### Built With

This project was built using modern web technologies:

*   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
*   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   JavaScript (ES6+)
*   CSS3 with Custom Properties
*   HTML5

## Features

*   **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Sticky Navigation**: An always-accessible navigation bar that highlights the current section.
*   **Dynamic Background**: A fixed, full-screen background image that creates a sense of depth.
