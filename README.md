## About The Project

This portfolio was created to be a central hub for my professional identity. It's a place where I can share my journey, highlight my achievements, and present my work to potential employers and collaborators. The design is intentionally bold and attention-grabbing, using a dark theme with red accents and a dynamic background to create a memorable experience.

*   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
